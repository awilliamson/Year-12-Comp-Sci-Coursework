# Year 12 Computer Science Coursework (2011-2012)
This is my coursework for AS-Level Computer Science, instead of using CSV's to store data i will be using MySQL (and a lovely module for python called MySQLdb) aswell as OOP to try and make as realistic a solution as i possibly can, along the way i hope to develop technique in object based programming, and increase my knowledge of python, and overall coding. It should be a fun time, and i'm guessing stressful in some situations, but with the help of the internet and the person i can always run to when shit hits the fan, Walrus, i should get through it in one piece!
